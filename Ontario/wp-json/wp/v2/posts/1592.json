These machines move autonomously across houses while simultaneously hoovering up dirt and dust, eliminating the need for strenuous cleaning efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though a robot vacuum cleaner could make your life easier, some people are wary of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After receiving reports of an intruder, Oregon sheriff&#8217;s officers were sent to a home, where they found their suspect to be a vacuum cleaner going about its business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Smart locks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hexa Control&#8217;s smart locks that You can open without the need for keys are becoming an increasingly popular option for certain people as a handy method to secure their belongings.
